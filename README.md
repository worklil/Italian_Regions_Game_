# Italian_Regions_Game

I created this program to show my Italian friend so we can play the Guess the Region Game. 

## Game Overview

When you start playing the game, you'll be presented with an empty map and a guess window. The window will show your current score in the game.

Please note that the locations of all the regions were found manually. Therefore, slight deviations in the text’s position are allowed. This will not affect your ability to recognize the region you need to guess or which ones you've already guessed.
